E. When I type Vote, start the simulation.
	1. First, run a campaign. Every politician each do should visit every each do Voter and do a stump speech.
			- Create a Voter class? Inherits from the person and politician?check

	2. If a politician is a Republican, he has a
		- 90% chance of convincing a Tea Party voter to vote for him #generate random number out of 100; if <= 90 
		- 75% chance of convincing a Conservative voter to vote for him
		- 50% chance of convincing a Neutral voter to vote for him
		- 25% chance of convincing a Liberal voter to vote for him
		- 10% chance of convincing a Socialist voter to vote for him

		If a politician is a Democrat, he has a
		- 90% chance of convincing a Socialist voter to vote for him
		- 75% chance of convincing a Liberal voter to vote for him
		- 50% chance of convincing a Neutral voter to vote for him
		- 25% chance of convincing a Conservative voter to vote for him
		- 10% chance of convincing a Tea Party voter to vote for him
	3. After every stump speech
		- puts a comment from the Voter indicating whether or not he has changed his mind
		- if the Voter is also Politician, puts a comment condemning what was said in the speech
